React UI Schema Renderer

Overview
The React UI Schema Renderer is a single-page React application designed to provide users with a convenient platform to visualize and interact with forms based on JSON UI schemas. The application's main screen is divided into two equal sections, offering users a seamless experience to input UI schemas on the left and instantly preview the rendered forms on the right.

Key Features
Dynamic Form Rendering: The application enables users to paste UI schemas on the left side, and it dynamically renders corresponding forms on the right-hand side. This allows users to visualize and interact with various form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, switches, and more.

JSON Editor: The left section includes a JSON editor where users can easily paste, edit, and manipulate UI schemas. The JSON editor provides a straightforward interface for managing the structure and content of UI schemas.

User-Friendly Interface: With a clean and intuitive design, users can seamlessly navigate between the JSON editor and the form preview. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing a smooth experience for both pasting UI schemas and interacting with the rendered forms.

Responsive Layout: The application is built with a responsive layout, ensuring a consistent and optimized experience across various devices and screen sizes.
